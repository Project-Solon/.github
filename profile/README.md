### CONTRIBUTORS
Abdera.ai is a university spin-off of UiT – The Arctic University of Norway in Tromsø. The start-up has been awarded the STUD-ENT grant (2022) of 1 000 000 NOK from Innovation Norway, as well as having been accepted into the selective Arctic Ignite program (2022) hosted by Norinnova, including an initial grant of 100 000 NOK. Abdera.ai was developed at the Machine Learning research group at UiT, and is assisted by the SFI Visual Intelligence.

### VALUES
Abdera.ai builds on fundamental values and ideas shared amongst the team members. First and foremost, we want to protect a neutral public debate. Online debate platforms should remain free, as to not inhibit freedom of speech, yet be restrictive enough to encourage user engagement from everybody, regardless of demographic. As this task will be very subjective in nature, we have reasoned that automating parts of the process will not only improve efficiency, but help define more objective criteria for comment moderation. We want to help rebuild a landscape for non-polarizing online debate. We hope that the effect of our contribution will contribute to online equality, accessibility, and freedom of speech.
